# Claude RTL Patch -- verified installer.
#
# Downloads patch.ps1 and patch.ps1.sig from GitHub, verifies the signature
# against an RSA-4096 public key hardcoded below (private key lives offline on
# the maintainer's machine -- see C1 mitigation), then elevates to install.
#
# A compromised GitHub repository alone is NOT enough to ship malicious code to
# users -- the attacker would also need the maintainer's offline private key.
#
# Public-key fingerprint (SHA-256 over the embedded JSON blob below):

# Cross-check this at the project README and any out-of-band channel (e.g.
# release notes, social) before trusting a fresh install.
